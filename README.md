This program was designed to calculate the topological genus of RNA structures that include Pseudoknots. 

## RNATypesByGraph.py

### Input 
- A text file with a list of locations for Segment Graph text file with All-Segments section

  #### Segment Graph Format:
  The segment graph text file is a file generated by bpRNA. Importantly these files must have the All-segments section which includes start and end locations for each RNA segment. 

### Output
- A folder Marked with the date and time containing the following files
- Tab delimited file with the Following fields for each RNA structure
  - File Name
  - Genus
  - Number of Stems
- Tab delimited file with the Following fields for each Psuedoknot (Some RNA Structures may have more than 1 Psuedoknot)
  - File Name
  - PK
  - Genus
  - Number of Stems
  
### Usage
    python RNATypesByGraph.py <File List>

### Examples

  Examples for Inputs, Outputs, and the segment files are all located withing the Examples Folder. 
    
### Requirements

- Python 3
- Numpy
